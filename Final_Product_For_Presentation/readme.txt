Our project is called Streamie, and it's mainly about synchronizing a Youtube video's playing progress to one's friends, so everyone who's using Streamie with their friends can watch the same video at the same progress. To achieve this goal, we used Html, Javascript, PHP, and Python to develop our product. 

Features:

Login, Register, Homage, Userprofile, Master video player, Viewer video player, All Sync video player, chat room
