standup/other agile meeting: 1.online 2.in person(in TUT0103)

meeting preparation: each team member should be ready to give update about their own work to team.

version control: group member should only commit what they are assigned to do. follow git commit message guidelines as specified [here](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) (from CSC290)

division of work: work shall be divided fairly to each team member, all important decisions should be made by vote.

submitting sprint deliverables and software: deliverables will be submitted at least 30 minutes before the deadline in order to avoid issues. members can volunteer to submit, and if there are no volunteers then we will take turns submitting for each deliverable. all members will review the submission to make sure it's correct.

contingency plan: if a team member drops out, the work of that member is splitted fairly to the rest of the members.
		              if a team member misses a meeting, a recording file will be sent to that member after meeting. This member is responsible for catching up with the team progress.
		              if a team member cannot complete the given task on time, one should notify the team in advance to find someone else to complete the task.
		              if a team member is academically dishonest, the work of that team member will not be accepted, and the responsible personnel shall redo and re-submit his/her work.
