Competition #1 Gaze

Gaze is a web based application that allows users to text chat or video chat while playing videos from Youtube or videos uploaded by users.
Gaze is similar to our product, but it only focuses on intimate relationships, like long distance couples and family members lives in different places.
The most significant difference between Gaze and Streamie is that Gaze does not provide group chat and other group chat related functions.
On the other hand, Streamie is a platform that not only for intimate partners to watch the same video at the same progress, but also
makes having many friends to watch the same video synchronously possible. Gaze may have been targeting a narrower group of audience (like 1 to 1 intimate friends), and for them to match our audience they must add more features like group chats.


Competition #2 NetflixParty

NetflixParty is an application that let its users to watch a netflix video together.
NetflixParty foucus on broadcasting netflix videos, while Streamie let its users to watch what ever Youtube videos they want and share it with their firends, parterners or families. NetflixParty is only compatible with Netflix, which requires a subscription. Streamie is compatible with other websites, allowing users greater flexibility. Streamie would work better for users who want to watch YouTube or their own videos. It's likely that NetflixParty didn't focus on audiences for other video platforms because they wanted to make a targeted product that supports specific Netflix features. For NetflixParty to target our audience, they must add support for different video platforms.


Competition #3 Vlightv
https://www.vlightv.com/

Vlightv is a mobile application that allows users to make new friends and watch videos together.
Vlightv is more geared towards social networking. It allows users to randomly pair up with each other, then watch a video together. Streamie is focused towards giving users who already know each other a tool to spend time with other. Users who want to communicate with intimate friends more than talk to strangers is our target audience. Since Vlightv is mainly an app for meeting new people (much like Tinder), they would not consider the audience that Streamie targets. If they did, they would have to market the product differently and provide more tools (such as simple share links) for friends to connect with each other.
