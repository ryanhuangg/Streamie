Based on our findings on "https://www.humber.ca/centreforteachingandlearning/instructional-strategies/teaching-methods/classroom-strategies-designing-instruction/collaborative-learning/roles-and-responsibilities-for-group-members.html", we were able to discuss and appoint responsibilites as seen fit. As the project phases continue on, our roles may become more specific and tailored to our individual skills and abilities. In Sprint 0, Angel took over the explanations for process.md while Ryan Huang and Edwin Zhou, and Neal created and pushed the md files, but ultimately the group collaborated and assisted each other on each task.

Meetings: Our team mainly uses Discord, WeChat and Facebook Messenger as our main communication tools. Meetings are usually 2-3 times per week on the Discord voicecall server, depending on each member's availabilty and agreeing to a specific time. If one or some members are still not able to show up to the agreed meeting time or have sudden circumstances, then we are able to fill them in one-on-one when they are free to chat later within the week.

Decision Making: We throw around general ideas and opinions, in which the group votes and the majority wins. We consider everyone's input and discuss which options are the most appropriate and suitable. For example, when we were suggesting potential names for our project, we each voted on which option we liked best. We considered DisStream, Streamie, MeStream, WeStream, OurStream, DuoStream, ManyStream, and ultimately the majority decided on Sreamie as our platform name and url. Another majority vote was for the project idea, which everyone was given a chance to put forward a potential project idea and ultimately we agreed on a video-sharing/networking web-based platform.

Prioritizing User Stories: How we prioritize our user story is whoever wrote the user story may decide its level of priority and if someone in the team has a disagreement or suggestion, they can voice it in group chat. Then, we can all discuss and agree what is the most adequate answer. If the user story issue does not carry forward or affect later user stories, then its priority would be considered lower.

Next Phase: For the next phase, we will begin to work on the structure our main idea for the video-sharing platform and agree to which language the group as a whole is most comfortable in using. We may elaborate and add to our UI, and discuss how to host the server.
