Retrospective meeting for Sprint 4:
The release planning meeting was conducted on March 17th, 2020. The meeting was held over Discord voice chat.
All members (Pengcheng Xu, Zhengliang Ding, Yan Chen Huang, Kai Jie Zhou, Wei Cong Qian, Angel Mei) participated in the meeting.

Since this sprint is the final sprint, we also continued the practice of holding more frequent meetings between team members. We conducted all meetings through discord since it has not been possible to meet up. This helped us communicate issues with each other more effectively. However, sometimes the tasks in the project were not clearly communicated between team members, which to an extent hindered our progress in our sprint. We had to hold more meetings between members to resolve those issues and distribute tasks accordingly.
