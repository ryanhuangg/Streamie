Retrospective meeting for Sprint 1:

The release planning meeting was conducted on Feb. 13th, 2020. The meeting was held after tutorial time in the library's study room.

All members (Pengcheng Xu, Zhengliang Ding, Yan Chen Huang, Kai Jie Zhou, Wei Cong Qian, Angel Mei) participated in the meeting.

For this sprint, we have completed all tasks that we have assigned for ourselves. Therefore, no unfinished tasks will be grouped into sprint 2 and we will start sprint 2 with the next set of user stories as planned.

We discussed the practices we used during sprint 1. We concluded that our strategy of booking study rooms in the library and holding our meetings physically there was effective because everyone contributed and decision making is easier in-person. It was also easier to show each other our work since we could simply show it on our laptops.   
For the next sprint, we may try holding more frequent meetings (either in person or on discord) to better inform each other of what we are doing. With more frequent meetings, it will also be possible to assign tasks along the way for a team member if they are done with a story and want to do more.  
There were no practices that were harmful to the team's productivity for this sprint.

Our best experience during was collectively deciding on the tasks and working on them individually, then finally putting them together in the master branch. Overall we agreed that sprint 1 was fun and there were no significant bad experiences.
