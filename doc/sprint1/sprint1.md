Spring 1 Planning Meeting(Feburary 6th, library study room)

Sprint Goal:
1. Determine the software architecture and programing language.  
2. Finish below user stories: 

    STACK-19: Initialize database(Owner: Wei Qian);
    -Jack (Wei Qian) used PHP scripting to connect to a my_sql databased and to query the login information of the user. He had minor issues connecting but ultimately resolved his issues after code review.
    
    STACK-2: Register as a user(Owner: Kai jie Zhou);
    -Edwin (Kai jie Zhou) wrote the login page using HTML and PHP to create connection to the database and querying the user entered information. He mainly did not run into any issues while completing the task.
    
    STACK-3: Login as a registered user(Owner: Yan Chen Huang); 
    -Listed below
    
    STACK-4: Wrong email or password(Owner: Yan Chen Huang);
    -Ryan (Yan Chen Huang) created the login page and the authentication page for the project site, which checks if the username/password combination is correct and redirects to another page accordingly. He ran into minor trouble when trying to read every line of a file, finding the appropriate combinations, and resolved his issue with PHP scripting.
    
    STACK-20: Play Youtube Videos from Youtube URL(Owner: Pengcheng Xu);
    -Neal (Pengcheng Xu) embedded the Youtube video URL link onto display page. He did not run into any major or minor issues while completing the task.
    
    STACK-21: Switch to Official Youtube API(Owner: Angel Mei);
    -Angel changed the embedded YouTube video URL display page to use the official YouTube API instead of simple embedding to allow for more direct control of each YouTube video. There was not many issues other than having to parse the YouTube URL properly.
    
    STACK-17: Switch mode: Light-Dark(Owner: Zhengliang Ding);
    -Marvin (Zhengliang Ding) worked on the switch light/dark mode feature, which was a small maneuver to the user's watching environment so that one can change the background colour to their visual preference and comfortability.
