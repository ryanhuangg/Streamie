Release Planning Meeting:

The release planning meeting was conducted on Feb. 6th, 2020. The meeting was held after tutorial time in the library's study room.

All members (Pengcheng Xu, Zhengliang Ding, Yan Chen Huang, Kai Jie Zhou, Wei Cong Qian, Angel Mei) participated in the meeting.

During the meeting, we discussed the end goal of this project. and we agreed on a conclusion.

For the release goal, we decided that we want to create a working version of the app with the core features. If we have enough time, we would like to implement some extra features and quality-of-life improvements for the app. We anticipate that we will complete the release goal before the end of the project and we will be able to implement several optional features that improve the application.

We have several user stories we'd like to complete for the release. The core features include:
- A functioning login (STACK-3 and STACK-4)
- A functioning registration page (STACK-2)
- Have a database storing the users' information (STACK-19)
- Ability to start a video share session (STACK-5)
- Ability to add/remove a friend in the app (STACK-6 and STACK-7)
- Send an invite to a friend to share videos (STACK-8)
- Adjust/mute the volume of the video (STACK-12 and STACK-13)
- Play YouTube videos from an URL (STACK-18)

For the other improvements we'd like to make, they are included in the scope of the project as well, and again we would likely be implementing several of these. We may also add some stories along the way.
- Chat with friends during the video session (STACK-10)
- Add reviews for videos that you have watched (STACK-11)
- Mute other users in the chat room (STACK-12)
- Have a private chat room (STACK-14)
- Show the chat history in a chat room (STACK-15)
- In your friends list, see who's currently online (STACK-16)
- Be able to adjust between dark/light mode (STACK-17)
- Use the official YouTube API for video playback (STACK-21)
