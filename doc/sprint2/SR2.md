Retroactive meeting for sprint 2:

The release planning meeting was conducted on Feb. 27th, 2020. The meeting was held during tutorial time after completing the demo.

All members (Pengcheng Xu, Zhengliang Ding, Yan Chen Huang, Kai Jie Zhou, Wei Cong Qian, Angel Mei) participated in the meeting.

For this sprint, we have completed all tasks that we have assigned for ourselves. Therefore, no unfinished tasks will be grouped into sprint 3 and we will start sprint 3 with the next set of user stories as planned.

We have discussed our strategies we used during sprint 2. For sprint 2, we held more meetings than sprint 1. However, due to the varying availability of
our team members we had to choose to hold our meetings on Discord. In those meetings, we were able to better keep track of each other's 
progress in the current sprint and we were able to find and solve problems that exist between our individual branches faster. For the next 
sprint, we decided that we will continue holding more frequent meetings through Discord. Holding meetings online is still effective and 
also solves issues regarding location/availability of team members, and holding meetings increases the efficiency of our work.

We also discussed harmful practices we had during sprint 2. This sprint spanned over reading week, and during reading week our communication 
was slightly lacking. We weren't as available as we are during regular weeks so our response times during reading week were slower than usual.
However, since there are no more breaks for the rest of the semester before the project is due and our communication has resumed to its usual state
after reading week, it's most likely that there will not be further communication problems for the later sprints.

Our best experience during sprint 2 was getting the YouTube videos to sync properly, and our worst experience is setting the database to work 
with everything else (like the login and registration).
